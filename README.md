# Online-Attendance-Management-System
“Online Attendance Management System” is developed for maintaining the attendance of the student on the daily basis in the college. Here the staff, who are handling the subjects, will be responsible to mark the attendance of the students. Each staff will be given a separate username and password based on the subject they handle. An accurate report based on student attendance is generated here. This system will also help in evaluating the attendance eligibility criteria of a student. Report of the student’s attendance on weekly and monthly basis is generated
